# Current Research 
**University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Statistics**  
Developing software in Julia for efficient full likelihood-based network methods with Professor Cécile Ané, as part of <a href="https://github.com/crsl4/PhyloNetworks.jl" target="_blank">PhyloNetworks Julia Package</a>

**University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Biostatistics**  
Developing <a href="https://github.com/coraallencoleman/ClusterRank" target="_blank">ClusterRank R Package</a> for mixture model clustered ranking with Professor Ron Gangnon. Uses inverse-variance weighted ranking and mixture models to produce simultaneous complete, optimal rankings with clustering, error estimates, and visualizations.

# Applied Data Science Projects
