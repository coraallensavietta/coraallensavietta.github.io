# Current Research 
**University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Statistics**  
Developing software in Julia for efficient full likelihood-based network estimation with Professor Cécile Ané, as part of <a href="https://github.com/crsl4/PhyloNetworks.jl" target="_blank">PhyloNetworks Julia Package</a>

**University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Biostatistics**  
Developing <a href="https://github.com/coraallensavietta/ClusterRank" target="_blank">ClusterRank R Package</a> for mixture model clustered ranking with Professor Ron Gangnon. Uses inverse-variance weighted ranking and mixture models to produce simultaneous complete, optimal rankings with clustering, error estimates, and visualizations.

# Applied Data Science Projects  
**University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Epidemiology**  
Lead analyst for a spatial analysis of breast cancer incidence and survival using generalized additive models, multiple imputation, and variable width smoothing techniques. *Paper in preparation*

**University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Medicine**  
Lead analyst for a study of UW’s MD/PhD training program. Used a variety of multivariate generalized linear mixed effects models and creative visualizations to answer a diverse set of applied questions. *Paper under review at Journal of Women's Health*
