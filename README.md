Cora Allen-Savietta enjoys building useful statistical tools to solve applied problems. In her dissertation work with Professor Cécile Ané at the <a href="https://stat.wisc.edu/staff/allen-savietta-cora" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>, she has developed a method to recover historical evolutionary relationships between species from modern DNA sequences. Her open-source phylogenetic network estimation software, PhyLiNC, is now available as part of the Julia package <a href="https://github.com/crsl4/PhyloNetworks.jl" target="_blank">PhyloNetworks.jl.</a>

# Applied Data Science Projects  
**University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Medicine**  
Lead analyst for a study of UW’s MD/PhD training program. Used a variety of multivariate generalized linear mixed effects models and creative visualizations to answer a diverse set of applied questions. Paper now available at *Journal of Women's Health*: <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/jwh.2019.8094" target="_blank">Gender Can Influence Student Experiences in MD–PhD Training</a>

**University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Epidemiology**  
Lead analyst for a spatial analysis of breast cancer incidence and survival using generalized additive models, multiple imputation, and variable width smoothing techniques. *Paper in preparation*

**University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Biostatistics**  
Developing <a href="https://github.com/coraallensavietta/ClusterRank" target="_blank">ClusterRank R Package</a> for mixture model clustered ranking with Professor Ron Gangnon. Uses inverse-variance weighted ranking and mixture models to produce simultaneous complete, optimal rankings with clustering, error estimates, and visualizations.
