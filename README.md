Data Scientist and Statistics PhD Candidate with 8 years of statistics experience and 2 years of software development experience.
# Current Data Science Projects  
**Reconstructing Ancient Evolution from Modern DNA**  
In her dissertation work with Professor Cécile Ané at the University of Wisconsin Department of Statistics, Cora is developing software to uncover ancient evolutionary history from modern DNA. Her open-source phylogenetic network estimation software is available as part of the Julia package <a href="https://github.com/crsl4/PhyloNetworks.jl" target="_blank">PhyloNetworks.jl.</a>

**Delivering Actionable Data-Driven Policy Recommendations**  
Lead analyst for a study of the University of Wisconsin's MD PhD training program. Used a variety of multivariate generalized linear mixed effects models and creative visualizations to deliver actionable, data-driven insights. Paper now available at *Journal of Women's Health*: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32349608/" target="_blank">Gender Can Influence Student Experiences in MD–PhD Training</a>

**Identifying Geographic Health Disparities from Registry Data**  
Lead analyst for a spatial analysis of breast cancer incidence and survival using generalized additive models, multiple imputation, and variable width smoothing techniques at the University of Wisconsin Department of Epidemiology.
